Heart Rate Monitor Assignment

This code takes ECG data in the form of time and voltage, and returns various attributes. The mean heart rate, the duration of the ECG, the voltage extremes, and the time of the detected peaks are all obtained. The attributes obtained are then stored in JSON format and a file with the same name as the csv is created. 

The associated test files verify functionality of the code.
